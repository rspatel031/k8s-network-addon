# Kubernetes Network Addon

### Calico Network Addon Configuration

- **Focus**: Network policy and security.
- **Features**:
  - Advanced network policies (Layer 3/4 and Layer 7 via Calico Enterprise).
  - Supports both networking (L3) and network security features.
  - Can operate in multiple modes: BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) or overlay (IP-in-IP or VXLAN).
  - Scales well for large, complex clusters.
- **Performance**: High performance due to its native routing capabilities without requiring overlays in some configurations.
- **Use Case**:
   - Best for clusters requiring network security policies.
   - Ideal for production environments with high scalability and performance needs.
- For full configuration, refer to the [Calico](https://github.com/rspatel031/k8s-network-addon/blob/main/calico/).

### Flannel Network Addon Configuration

  - **Focus**: Simple networking.
  - **Features**:
    - Easy to set up and manage.
    - Supports various backends like VXLAN, Host-GW, and WireGuard (for encryption).
    - Primarily provides a flat network for pods to communicate across nodes.
  - **Performance**:
    - Lower performance compared to Calico, especially for large clusters, because it relies on overlays.
  - **Use Case**:
    - Best for basic networking needs without complex policy requirements.
    - Suitable for small or medium-sized clusters where simplicity is key.
  - For full configuration, refer to the [Flannel](https://github.com/rspatel031/k8s-network-addon/blob/main/flannel/).

### Weave Network Addon Configuration

  - **Focus**: Simplicity and full-mesh networking.
  - **Features**:
    - Supports encryption for secure communication between pods.
    - Easy to deploy and integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes.
    - Uses a mesh overlay network to connect pods across nodes.
  - **Performance**:
    - Slightly slower than Calico but performs well for small to medium clusters.
  - **Use Case**:
    - Best for environments requiring encrypted traffic and ease of setup.
    - Suitable for small to medium-sized clusters with moderate scalability needs.
  - For full configuration, refer to the [Weave Net](https://github.com/rspatel031/k8s-network-addon/blob/main/weave/).
